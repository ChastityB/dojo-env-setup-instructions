# Troubleshooting

**If you encounter an error during installation:**
**_You may continue to work through the first half of the data enrichment week 1 lessons & assignments while troubleshooting your local installation!_** The first lessons and assignments can be completed using Google Colab.

**Reach out on the \#[ds-python-installation Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/738494436467539968/1099094868762042400) with the following info:**

- A) Which step are you on? (e.g. Step 2.3.3 Confirm the env was created)
- B) Which OS you are using (e.g. Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac with an mchip, Mac with an Intel processor, etc.)
- C) Let us know if you've previously installed an older version of Python.
- D) Attach your copy of the environment tester notebook and the FINAL_REPORT.txt files.
- E) Include any additional screenshots of the error/issue you are running into, whenever possible.
- F) Add any additional details or info you think may be helpful for us to know.
  - For example:
    - "My computer is really old and I think that may be part of the problem."
    - "I share this computer with someone else who also uses python"
    - "This is my work computer and I am not an administrator." etc

**If you do not receive a response by the end of the day on Discord, please email your instructor with the same information explained above.**

- An instructor or TA will get back to you within 1 business day with the next steps for you to try.
- You will most likely need to set up a Zoom call and share your screen for us to help.
